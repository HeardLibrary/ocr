# Building our training set

In order to train the handwriting text recognition model, we need to feed it labelled text with correct transcriptions. This is called the training set or the ground truth (GT) data.

Nathan has already scanned the individual pages of the personal diary of Dr. Lucius E. Burch (1874-1959) from our Special Collections.[^1] Dr. Burch was born in 1874 in Nashville, the son of a former Confederate officer and secretary of the U.S. Senate. Dr. Burch graduated from the Vanderbilt School of Medicine in 1896 and was a prominent member of the Vanderbilt football team. In 1904, he joined the Vanderbilt School of Medicine as Professor of Gynecology. Ten years later, he was appointed dean. Upon retiring as dean in 1925, Dr. Burch was appointed chairman of Vanderbilt's department of gynecology and obstetrics, where he served another twenty years.

The diary utilized for our training set is from 1921. Each of you has been assigned a folder of about 40 pages of the diary to transcribe.

Your first few pages might take a while as you get used to reading the handwriting. As you get more familiar with it, it will go faster.

## Use a text editor

Create your transcriptions in a text editor. Do not use MS Word or other word processing programs because these come with hidden characters that cause problems down the road.

A simple plaintext editor comes pre-installed on your computer (Notes on Mac or Notepad on Windows). However, we recommend using [Atom](atom.io) or [SublimeText](www.sublimetext.com). These offer more features like line numbers and syntax highlighting that you will find useful.       

## Create transcriptions

For each image file, you will create a plaintext file of the same name. If your image file name is `005_L.jpg`, your output file name should be `005_L.txt`

Each line in the image should be a separate line in your file. Be sure to include every punctuation mark and do not correct any spelling or grammar mistakes in the original.

If the handwriting seems faint, you can play with the contrast of the image file.

**What if I can't make out the word?**

> You will inevitably come across a word or two that you simply can't interpret. When that happens, write ''[unintelligible]''. Even if only one or two letters of a word are unintelligible, write ''[unintelligible]'' for the entire word.

You do not need to include the dateline on the top of the image. Just include the handwritten text.

Upload your txt files to the same folder as your images.
